FastColoredTextBox
==================

Fast Colored TextBox is text editor component for .NET.
Allows you to create custom text editor with syntax highlighting.
It works well with small, medium, large and very-very large files.

It has such settings as foreground color, font style, background color which can be adjusted for arbitrarily selected text symbols. One can easily gain access to a text with the use of regular expressions. WordWrap, Find/Replace, Code folding and multilevel Undo/Redo are supported as well. 

This version is altered to ONLY support SQL code. Also this version will be simplified (no bookmarks, macros) and will be used as an plugin to my QuickSQL program (which isn't open source).
Because my QuickSQL program uses my own multi-language framework, the dialogs will be removed from this control.
